# Phish-Blocker

AI call screener built on LiveKit Agents + Twilio SIP + Amazon Nova Sonic (Bedrock).
An inbound call is screened by a conversational agent that detects scam signals,
interrogates suspicious callers, cold-transfers verified callers to the resident,
and renders a live verdict on a dashboard.

## What it does

- **Screens unknown callers** — conversational agent asks who is calling and why
- **Detects scam intent** — Moss semantic retrieval + LLM `flag_scam_signal` (conversation only, no voice biometrics)
- **Interrogates suspicious callers** — claim-specific verification questions; deflection is a strong signal
- **Auto-hangup persistent scammers** — sustained high score across multiple turns triggers BLOCK + goodbye
- **Transfers verified callers** — PASS verdict → SIP REFER cold transfer to `RESIDENT_PHONE`
- **Known-contact fast-path** — caller ID in `data/contacts.json` → silent PASS + immediate transfer (no agent)
- **Live dashboard** — transcript, scam score, tactic chips, verdict, transfer status

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env   # fill in LiveKit + AWS + Moss keys
```

Enable **Nova Sonic 2** in the AWS Bedrock console before running the agent.

## Run (two terminals)

1. `python -m phish_blocker.dashboard` — open http://localhost:8080
2. `python -m phish_blocker.agent dev` — starts the LiveKit agent worker

**Moss index (one-time):** `python scripts/build_moss_index.py`

**Dashboard-only demo (no agent):** `python scripts/demo_dashboard.py`

**Console demo (no telephony):** `python -m phish_blocker.agent console --text`

## Telephony (do this FIRST — riskiest part)

Follow LiveKit's "Inbound calls via Twilio" guide:

- Buy a Twilio voice number.
- Create a TwiML Bin pointing at your LiveKit SIP URI.
- Create a LiveKit inbound trunk + dispatch rule (`lk sip ...`).
- **Trunk credentials must match the TwiML Bin** — #1 failure mode.
- Set `RESIDENT_PHONE` in `.env` and test cold transfer on a real call.

Optional: set `TWILIO_PSTN_DOMAIN` (Elastic SIP trunk termination domain) if SIP REFER needs a `sip:` URI target.

## Contacts allowlist

Edit `data/contacts.json`:

```json
[
  { "name": "Dave", "phone": "+14155551234", "relationship": "friend" }
]
```

Phone numbers are normalized to E.164. Known callers bypass the agent entirely and are cold-transferred to `RESIDENT_PHONE`. Caller ID can be spoofed — this is a convenience layer, not authentication.

## Demo script (~90s)

1. **Stakes:** AI screens calls so scam callers never reach you; legit callers get through.
2. **Scam call (live):** Teammate plays IRS/gift-card script → dashboard score climbs → agent interrogates → deflects → BLOCK → auto-hangup.
3. **Known contact:** Call from a number in `contacts.json` → instant PASS + transfer (no screening).
4. **Unknown legit caller:** "Dave confirming lunch Tuesday" → brief screen → PASS → transfer.

**Offline UI rehearsal:** run `demo_dashboard.py` while the dashboard is open.

## Demo-day risks

- Venue WiFi is hostile to realtime audio — bring a phone hotspot.
- Warm the pipeline with one throwaway call before presenting (cold start is slow).
- Twilio trial accounts add a preamble and restrict numbers — upgrade/verify beforehand.
- Test SIP REFER transfer to `RESIDENT_PHONE` before demo day.
- Stay on the conversational-intent story. Phone audio is 8 kHz; do NOT claim acoustic deepfake detection.
